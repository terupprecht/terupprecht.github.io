        <h2>Education</h2>
        <h4>Statistics and Data Science (M. Sc.)</h4>
        <p>Between April 2022 and March 2025, I completed my Master's degree in <i>Statistics and Data Science</i> with a specialization
            in <i>Machine Learning</i>. The program, taught in English, combined theoretical courses such as Spatial Statistics, Statistical Inference, Supervised
            Learning, Regression for Correlated Data, Statistical Learning Theory, Optimization and Statistical Modelling with practical components like Advanced Programming (in R), a seminar on Spatial Statistics, and a group consulting
            project.</p>
            <p> As part of my specialization, I also successfully completed courses in Automated Machine Learning, ] Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing, ML and DL in Python,  and Deep
            Learning.</p>
            <p class = "spaced-paragraph">I wrote my Master’s thesis in the Biomedical Statistics and Data Science group under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Christian Müller, titled
            <i>Predictive Modeling of Marine Microbial Abundances – Comparing Multiple Machine Learning Modeling Strategies</i>.</p>
        <h4>Statistik (B. Sc.)</h4>
        <p>From October 2018 to March 2022, I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Statistics with a minor in Geophysics at LMU Munich.
            The program was taught in German and covered foundational mathematics including Analysis I & II and Linear Algebra for Statisticians, as well as core subjects such as Descriptive Statistics, Probability Theory I & II, and Linear Models.
            Advanced statistical courses included Multivariate Methods, Basics of Generalized Regression, Sampling Theory, and Economic and Social Statistics.

            <p>I gained practical programming experience through courses in Statistical Software (SAS), Statistical Software (R), and an introduction to programming and software development in Java.
            Additionally, I applied statistical methods in interdisciplinary and applied contexts — for example, in a bachelor seminar on Tourism in Space and Time (in collaboration with geographers), a beginner’s project on Double Earthquake Occurrence,
            and a statistical practicum exploring the link between rural populism and the electoral success of the NSDAP (in cooperation with LMU’s Department of Political Science).</p>
            
            <p>As part of my minor in Geophysics, I studied subjects such as Introduction to Earth Sciences I, Introduction to Geophysics, Global Geophysics, Seismology, and Geophysical Data Analysis.
            </p>
        <p class="spaced-paragraph">In my Bachelor’s thesis, “Triggering Processes of Seismic Activity – Advanced Regression Models for the Analysis of Aftershock Productivity,” supervised by Prof. Dr. Küchenhoff, I was able to integrate my major and minor fields of study.</p>

        <h2>Working Experience</h2>
        <h4>University Teaching Assistent</h4>
        <p>October 2023 - present, <i>Department of Statistics, LMU Munich</i></p>
        <p class="spaced-paragraph">I supervised "Statistik I & II für Studierende der Wirtschaftswissenschaften" [Statistics 1 & 2] as well as "Grundlagen der Statistik für Studierende der Wirtschaftswissenschaften" [Fundamentals of Statistics for economics students]. My responsibilities included leading weekly seminars
            with up to 150 students, creating assessments, invigilating exams, and evaluating results.</p>
        <h4>Tutor</h4>
        <p>April 2024, September 2024 – October 2024, <i>Department of Statistics, LMU Munich</i></p>
        <p class="spaced-paragraph">As a tutor for "Statistische Software (SAS) - SAS-Kurs" [Statistical Software (SAS) - SAS-Course], I supported students through direct supervision and
            personalized guidance to enhance their understanding and practical skills.</p>
        <h4>Exam Corrector</h4>
        <p>August 2024 - October 2024, <i>Information- and Servicecenter - Wirtschaftswissenschaftliche
            Prüfungen (ISC), LMU Munich</i></p>
        <p class="spaced-paragraph"> In my work as an exam grader of the exam "Mathematik für Studierende der Wirtschaftswissenschaften", I evaluated the students' performance in the exam and assisted during the exam review session.</p>
